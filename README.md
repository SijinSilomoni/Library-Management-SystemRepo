The Library Management System utilizes a structured SQL database to streamline library operations, including book cataloging, customer management, and tracking book issues and returns. The system includes tables such as Branch, Employee, Books, Customer, Issue Status, and Return Status, each with specific attributes and relationships, and primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and consistency. SQL queries enable efficient data retrieval and manipulation, such as listing available books, counting employees per branch, and identifying customers who have issued books. This SQL-based system enhances the efficiency and organization of library management tasks, providing a robust solution for maintaining and accessing library information.
